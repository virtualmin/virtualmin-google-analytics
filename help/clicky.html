<header>Clicky account ID</header>

To enable Clicky tracking for this virtual server, you must first
sign up for an account at <a target=_new href=http://getclicky.com/>http://getclicky.com/</a>. Once this is done, you will be given Javascript
to add to your website, which contains an ID like <tt>12555</tt>.
Instead of adding this Javascript manually, just enter the ID into this
field. <p>
