<header>Piwik analytics server URL</header>

In order to use Piwik for generating statistics on your website, Virtualmin
needs to know the base URL of the Piwik installation to send stats to. This
is typically something like <tt>http://yourdomain.com/piwik/</tt>. If you
installed Piwik using Virtualmin, you can see the URL on the 
<b>Install Scripts</b> page. <p>
