<header>Enable Analyics tracking?</header>

When this feature is active, all HTML pages served by this website will
have Javascript added automatically to enable tracking via analytics
services such as Google Analytics, MyBlogLog and Quantcast. <p>

However, because each site must be associated with an account you will need
to use the <b>Analytics Accounts</b> page under the <b>Logs and Reports</b>
menu to enter account IDs for each service before tracking is activated. To
obtain account IDs, you must first sign up for one of more of these
tracking services, which can be done at their websites. <p>
