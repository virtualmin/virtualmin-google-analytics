<header>Piwik site ID</header>

If you have installed the free Piwik analytics package (either using Virtualmin
or manually), each site that it reports on is identified by a numeric site
ID. This is typically a small number (like 5), and can be seen in the 
Javascript that Piwik suggests you add to your web pages in the 
<tt>piwik_idsite</tt> variable. <p>
